# YouTube Downloader
Simple .NET Framework application for downloading YouTube audio and converting it to MP3 file.
You can download audio from direct link or from whole playlist and even combine playlists into big download list.
There's also feature to download files asynchronously with high speed.
* (Only Polish language available right now - working on english translation)

If you want to be able to convert audio to MP3 you need ffmpeg and ffprobe library.

You can compile it from official open source or download already compiled ones (~Get packages & executable files):
